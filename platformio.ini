; PlatformIO Project Configuration File
;
; Supported platforms for the MobiFlight firmware are:
; atmega2560
; promicro
; uno
;
; Version numbers for releases are automatically applied by GitHub
; during the release build process based on the tag associated with
; the GitHub release.

; To ensure builds work correctly in GitHub the default_envs
; should always be set to all supported MobiFlight platforms.
; If you want to only build a single platform locally during
; development use VSCode to change the target to a non-default
; by clicking on the target name in the bottom status bar.
